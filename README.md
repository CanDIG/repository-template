# CanDIG Repository Template
An example for what should be in any CanDIG repository.  In progress. Not at all ready for use. 

## Branch structure

All CanDIG repositories follow a branch pattern where the default branch is `develop` and the `stable` branch indicates a stable production release.

## Things to edit:
* README-template.md - adapted from [@scottydocs/README-template.md](https://github.com/scottydocs/README-template.md/tree/master)
